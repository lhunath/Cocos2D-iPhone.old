cocos2d for iPhone
------------------

cocos2d for iPhone[1] is a framework for building 2D games, demos, and other
graphical/interactive applications. It is based on the cocos2d [2] (python)
design:
  it uses the same API and design, but instead of using python it uses objective-c.


Main features
    * Scene management (workflow)
    * Transitions between scenes
    * Sprites and Sprite Sheets
    * Effects: Lens, Ripple, Waves, Liquid, etc.
    * Actions (behaviours): 
        * Trasformation Actions: Move, Rotate, Scale, Fade, Tint, etc.
        * Composable actions: Sequence, Spawn, Repeat, Reverse
        * Ease Actions: Exp, Sin, Cubic, etc.
        * Misc actions: CallFunc, OrbitCamera
    * Basic menus and buttons
    * Integrated Chipmunk 2d physics engine
    * Particle system
    * Fast text rendering: Fixed and Variable width fonts
    * Texture Atlas support
    * Tile Map support
    * Parallax scrolling
    * High Score server
    * Touch/Accelerometer
    * Portrait and Landscape mode
    * Integrated Pause/Resume
	* Integrated Slow motion/Fast forward
    * Fast textures: PVRTC 2-bit & 4-bit textures, RGBA 16-bit (and 32-bit) textures
    * Language: objective-c
    * Open Source: Compatible with open and closed source projects
    * OpenGL ES 1.1 based 

Experimental features:
    * Motion Streak / Ribbon support
    * Sound Engine support
    * Integrated Box2d physics engine

This library does not work with the toolchain, but it
should be easy to port it to it.

How to run the tests
--------------------

Xcode -> View -> Customize toolbar
Then, drag "Active Target" and "Active Executable" to your top project tool bar.
Select the test you want to view in both drop downs and hit Build and Go.
